ENSEMBL API
===========

Exercise 2
----------
Begin a script - copy it from the pdf slides
Look for info on the website: http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/Doxygen/core-api/classBio_1_1EnsEMBL_1_1Registry.html#a7e564f1b1bf7d176041f700713a7c1bf

verbose => boolean - have to set it to TRUE or FALSE (set to TRUE)

Information is tored at different levels - colones (tiling path), contigs, chromosome ==> assemble bigger bits from small bits

While and shift - takes up less memory rather than using foreach loop
Print name, version and rank
 -clones and contigs are stored without a 'version' - they can be shared
 - clinicians are looking at the details, GRCH38 - for human, spring

Slice object - region of a chromosome, fetches info by region, 1 is positive strand, -1 is negative strand
	e.g. $slice = $slice_adaptor->fetch_by_region('chromosome', '12',
1e6, 2e6);

Features
--------
slice and feature_slice canbe the same - but don't have to be

NMsomething - identifier for something stored in RefSeq
